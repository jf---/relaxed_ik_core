  abstract   = {This thesis presents an additive joining technique and an adaptive detailing pipeline for robotic assembly of spatial structures. The thesis starts by identifying how designing for and building with robots brings new challenges for the designer who --now in explicit control of both design and production-- needs to be knowledgeable in the possibilities of robotic joining tools and processes. The context of inquiry is a case study of spatial structures in steel with non-planar interfaces between elements. The three-dimensional nature of the interfaces presents an unprecedented building challenge in robotic fabrication, requiring an investigation of appropriate materials, processes, and fitting techniques to fix the parts in space. These challenges, dependent on diverse expertise and knowledge, funnel back to the current lack of consolidated detailing concepts and methods for robotic fabrication. The investigation is, therefore, twofold:   First, an additive joining technique to join metal parts is developed. The technique applies the known Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) process in place directly on the parts to be joined during assembly, in contrast with typical approaches where connections are prefabricated in an exclusive 3D printing environment. The resulting in place WAAM (IPWAAM) technique is developed alongside tolerance handling procedures to measure and adapt to the actual location of parts, as well as collision control methods to move safely between obstacles during the 3D printing process.   Second, a computational detailing pipeline is developed to coordinate the different challenges of designing and building IPWAAM connection details. The pipeline integrates robotic, material, and functional requirements and, by linking the digital and physical models of the IPWAAM connections, it allows the design to adapt as needed based on the building data gathered during production, resulting in a novel adaptive detailing approach.   The thesis develops through physical experiments to test the joining and detailing approaches and virtual experiments to anticipate the challenges of their application in the context of spatial structures. As a result, the physical outcomes demonstrate an unprecedented method for joining non-planar metal parts. Finally, the adaptive detailing approach provides a basis for detailing computationally in the context of robotic fabrication, aiming to support the current efforts of building a rich and transparent digital building culture.},

The paper also details the novel integrated design, engineering and fabrication framework and the manufacturing and assembly processes used for the project. The research, motivated by the rapid growth in large-scale 3D concrete printing (3DCP), addresses the current lack of both design tools and integrated design-to-production solutions. It is guided by the insight regarding the applicability of design and analysis methods used in unreinforced masonry to large-scale, layered 3D printing with compression dominant materials such as concrete. Thus, the underlying computational framework and integrated design environment further extends and adapts advances in the computational design and analysis of unreinforced masonry structures to 3DCP masonry blocks. Adopting an unreinforced masonry paradigm for the design of 3DCP structures can make it possible to (i) reduce the amount of concrete used by allowing precise placement of concrete only where needed along the compressive flow of forces, (ii) reduce the amount of steel needed by reducing tensile and flexural strength requirements through a compression-appropriate design of both the global, shape and the block discretisation, and (iii) reuse components, repair the structures and recycle materials more easily. This paper builds on the relevance of the computational masonry paradigm to both delivering the ecological promises of 3DCP and to the development of a 3DCP-specific, design-to-production toolkit.},

We first conduct an optimization formulation to compute an initial vector field that is well aligned with those anchor vectors specified by users according to different manufacturing requirements. The vector field is further optimized to be an irrotational field so that it can be completely realized by a scalar field's gradients. Iso-surfaces of the scalar field will be employed as the layers of working surfaces for multi-axis volume peeling in the rough machining. Algorithms are also developed to remove and process singularities of the fields. Our method has been tested on a variety of models and verified by physical experimental machining.},

In this paper, we present a new computational framework to generate specially designed layers and toolpaths of multi-axis 3D printing for strengthening a model by aligning filaments along the directions with large stresses. The major challenge comes from how to effectively decompose a solid into a sequence of strength-aware and collision-free working surfaces. We formulate it as a problem to compute an optimized governing field together with a selected orientation of fabrication setup. Iso-surfaces of the governing field are extracted as working surface layers for filament alignment. Supporting structures in curved layers are constructed by extrapolating the governing field to enable the fabrication of overhangs. Compared with planar-layer based Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, models fabricated by our method can withstand up to 6               .               35{\texttimes} loads in experimental tests.},

  abstract  = {The introduction of robotic arms in additive manufacturing enables the scaling up of three-dimensional (3D) printing processes and the realization of nonplanar path geometries. As a result, novel design potential is unlocked by having control over the layered configuration of paths in the object, and 3D printing becomes viable for architectural applications. However, the various challenges associated with creating feasible nonplanar layered paths for the realization of large-scale objects are hindering their integration in the design process and broad use. This work presents methods that contribute to the flexible and intuitive design of nonplanar layered paths for robotic printing. We focus on the challenges related to the realization of single-shell bifurcating structures, with emphasis on the paths' behavior on the bifurcating moments of the shapes. Our methods are based on the use of design techniques that originate from implicit shape representation and on the detection of critical points on the surface through the lens of distance functions. We present fabricated prototypes printed with nonplanar paths that showcase the possibilities of our methods.},

The advent of robotic arms has created great potential in the 3D printing industry for the realization of non-planar print paths that allow transitioning between different orientations during the print. However, this potential is often not fully realized due to the various challenges associated with the design of feasible non-planar print paths. Inspired by the ubiquitous key-framing technique in animation, where an input of limited degrees of freedom is used to describe a complex behavior, we propose a method to generate non-planar layered print paths subject to the input of the designer, by specifying a series of target curves on the surface of a mesh. Our method generates intermediary print paths with a direction that interpolates that of the targets while respecting the sequence and distances between neighboring paths imposed by fabrication constraints. The resulting print paths have variable layer height, and their realization relies on variable end-effector orientation. We present several examples and fabricated prototypes and make qualitative comparisons to planar slicing, to showcase the capabilities of our method.},

The distortion has a great influence on the structural performance and dimensional accuracy, e.g., for assembly. It is therefore of critical importance to model, predict and, ultimately, reduce distortion. In this paper, we present a computational framework for fabrication sequence optimization to minimize distortion in multi-axis additive manufacturing (e.g., robotic wire arc additive manufacturing), in which the fabrication sequence is not limited to planar layers only. We encode the fabrication sequence by a continuous pseudo-time field, and optimize it using gradient-based numerical optimization. To demonstrate this framework, we adopt a computationally tractable yet reasonably accurate model to mimic the material shrinkage in metal additive manufacturing and thus to predict the distortion of the fabricated components. Numerical studies show that optimized curved layers can reduce distortion by orders of magnitude as compared to their planar counterparts.},

An existing challenge is how to effectively generate the curved layers satisfying multiple objectives simultaneously. This paper presents a general slicing framework for achieving multiple fabrication objectives including support free, strength reinforcement and surface quality. These objectives are formulated as local printing directions varied in the volume of a solid, which are achieved by computing the rotation-driven deformation for the input model. The height field of a deformed model is mapped into a scalar field on its original shape, the isosurfaces of which give the curved layers of multi-axis 3D printing. The deformation can be effectively optimized with the help of quaternion fields to achieve the fabrication objectives. The effectiveness of our method has been verified on a variety of models.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an Interactive Design Environment and outlines the underlying computational framework to adapt equilibrium modelling techniques from rigid-block masonry to the multi-phase material typically used in large-scale additive manufacture. It focuses on enabling the synthesis of geometries that are structurally and materially feasible vis-a-vis 3D printing with compression-dominant materials. The premise of the proposed research is that the material printed in layers can be viewed as micro-scale bricks that are initially soft, and harden over time---a kind of micro-stereotomy. This insight, and the observation about the necessity of design exploration yields the principal contributions of the paper: A computational framework that allows for geometric reasoning about shape and exploration of associated design-space, and early, proof-of-concept results.},

The usefulness and extension of this representation in the synthesis and analysis of geometries for the process of large-scale, layered concrete 3D printing has been previously articulated by the authors. This paper fully extends the implicit representation used previously in shape-design to fabrication-related processing of compressive skeletal structures for realisation by robotic 3D printing of concrete. In particular, we use an initial value formulation of a propagating front to process the nodes and bars of a given funicular spatial structure.},

  abstract   = {While a powder bed 3D printer device is easy to use, the cleaning task after each print is a tedious job. Consequently, a proper approach is to employ an industrial robot for this task. The robot should be programmed quickly and efficiently with the off-line robot programming (OLP) method. In this paper, an OLP system based on Python and OpenCasCade libraries is introduced to generate robot trajectories for cleaning the printer powder bed immediately and autonomously. The cleaning operation is divided into three sub-operations: top layer raster, raster from the offset, and offset oriented. Several algorithms are employed to satisfy sub-operations autonomously from a CAD model. Raster path, wire, and yaw angle calculators are essential algorithms. Finally, a graphical simulation illustrates the operation efficiency. The proposed system can generate a cleaning path immediately and due to utilizing open resource libraries, there is a wide range of applicable personalization.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents BrepGen, a diffusion-based generative approach that directly outputs a Boundary representation (B-rep) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. BrepGen represents a B-rep model as a novel structured latent geometry in a hierarchical tree. With the root node representing a whole CAD solid, each element of a B-rep model (i.e., a face, an edge, or a vertex) progressively turns into a child-node from top to bottom. B-rep geometry information goes into the nodes as the global bounding box of each primitive along with a latent code describing the local geometric shape. The B-rep topology information is implicitly represented by node duplication. When two faces share an edge, the edge curve will appear twice in the tree, and a T-junction vertex with three incident edges appears six times in the tree with identical node features. Starting from the root and progressing to the leaf, BrepGen employs Transformer-based diffusion models to sequentially denoise node features while duplicated nodes are detected and merged, recovering the B-Rep topology information. Extensive experiments show that BrepGen advances the task of CAD B-rep generation, surpassing existing methods on various benchmarks. Results on our newly collected furniture dataset further showcase its exceptional capability in generating complicated geometry. While previous methods were limited to generating simple prismatic shapes, BrepGen incorporates free-form and doubly-curved surfaces for the first time. Additional applications of BrepGen include CAD autocomplete and design interpolation. The code, pretrained models, and dataset are available at https://github.com/samxuxiang/BrepGen.},
